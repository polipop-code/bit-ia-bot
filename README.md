
# Bit-IA BOT 

"Based on Text Interface Artificial Intelligence", developed with the help of the
Discord API v11.6.4, this project aimed to improve the online education quality
implementing an assistant BOT to help to configure a classroom environment in a
Discord server.
## Installation

First
Invite to [Bit-IA](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=904816237010354237&scope=bot&permissions=271699064) at your Discord server.

Once Bit-IA is inside your Discord sever, go to any `text channel` and run the next command:
```bash
.classroom
```
And all is ready （＾∀＾）ﾉｼ
